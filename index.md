## Overview

College Cooking is an application that helps college students make affordable, healthy, and accessible meals. It provides students with recipes that respect common constraints such as limited kitchen resources, limited cooking skills, limited time, and limited access to grocery stores.

### Key Features

* Recipes designed for basic kitchen setups, primarily using a toaster oven or microwave.
* Ingredients that are easy to find within walking distance of campus.
* Customizable filters for dietary preferences (e.g., vegan, gluten-free).
* Estimated cost and serving size for each recipe.
* Estimated preparation time for each recipe.

### Purpose

Many college students resort to fast food or vending machine snacks due to limited resources, which impacts both their health and budget. College Cooking aims to improve student nutrition and support a healthier lifestyle by making cooking accessible and affordable.

## Developer Guide

This section provides developers with information on setting up, deploying, and maintaining College Cooking.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies with:
   ```bash
   npm install

   createdb collegecooking

   npx generate

   npx migrate dev

   npm run dev 


#### ESLint

BowFolios includes a [.eslintrc](//eslintrcfile) file to define the coding style adhered to in this application. You can invoke ESLint from the command line as follows:

```
npm run lint
```

ESLint should run without generating any errors.

It's significantly easier to do development with ESLint integrated directly into your IDE (such as IntelliJ).

## Milestones

The objective of Milestone 1 was to design HTML mockups representing the core pages of the BowFolio system. This milestone provided a visual structure and helped plan the layout and navigation.

Milestone 1 was managed using [College Cooking Milestone Board M1](link):

### Milestone 2: Data model development

In Milestone 2, we focused on developing the data model, which included setting up MongoDB collections and implementing the operations required to support BowFolioâ€™s functionality. This step was crucial for the backend infrastructure, enabling data storage, retrieval, and management within the application.

## Milestone 3: Final touches

The purpose of Milestone 3 was to polish the codebase, address any remaining UI issues, and ensure a smooth user experience. This final pass involved debugging, enhancing styling, and improving overall functionality.
